# Default Payment Credit Card Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of default payments on credit cards using a machine learning model. The model has been deployed on Microsoft Azure, making it accessible via a REST API for real-time predictions.

Key components include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation using **XGBoost** as the primary algorithm
- FastAPI for serving the model via an API
- Streamlit for providing an interactive web interface for users
- **Azure Deployment**: The model is deployed on Azure for scalable, real-world use.
- CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Training the **XGBoost** algorithm to predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on their credit card payment.
- **Azure Deployment**: The trained model is deployed on Microsoft Azure, enabling easy access via a REST API.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- **User Interface**: A Streamlit app allows users to input client details and receive a prediction on whether the client is likely to default.
